Car Display Board (TouchGFX Project)
Overview

This project is a car display board built with TouchGFX. It provides drivers with clear, real-time information about the vehicle while offering programmers a modular foundation for further development.

The display is designed to be:

Driver-friendly → Simple, intuitive interface

Developer-friendly → Clear code structure, easy customization

For Drivers
Features

Real-time display of speed, motor controller commands, and battery status

Dashboard inputs for turn signals, cruise, hazards, and regen

Error reporting (motor controller + BPS)

Auxiliary battery monitoring
